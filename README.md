## Kanji List

* **GRADE**: [Kyouiku kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji)
  are grouped by school grades,
  while [Jouyou kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)
  are grouped based on the 
  [Kanji Kentei](http://www.kanken.or.jp/kanken/outline/data/outline_degree_national_list.pdf) levels.
  The 2020 list (with prefecture kanji in 4th grade) is used.
  Characters are further sorted and grouped by representative readings.
* **ICE**: Ice's Hanzigong-style kanji grouping.
  Characters are grouped based on the visual "core" part
  (usually the phonetic component, but not always),
  and the cores are grouped based on themes
  (e.g., Nature includes 日, 月, 夕, 土, 山, ...).
  The characters include Jouyou kanji and a number of other common characters.

# Notes on character forms

A proper font must be used to display Japanese characters correctly.
The bottom of 直 should be an L instead of a horizontal line.
