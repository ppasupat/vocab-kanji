# Selecting a character

* Search for a character using the search box
* Alternatively, browse the characters from the lists
  * E1 to E6 contain [Kyōiku kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji)
    sorted by onyomi and grouped by school grades
  * J1 to J6 contain the rest of [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)
    sorted by onyomi and divided into groups of 200
  * X contains other interesting kanji
* Alternatively, add `?q=<character>` to the URL

# Viewing external resources

To view external references about the chosen character:
* Choose an external resource from the dropdown box
  * Since the page is served on HTTPS, while some external web pages use HTTP,
    mixed content protection has to be disabled to view some resources
* Clicking on the vocabulary also triggers a search on WWWJDIC

# Alternative character lists

* Add `?list=kklc` to the URL for the list from
  [The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568365268)
* Add `?list=rtk` to the URL for the list from
  [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi)
  Book 1 (6th ed.)
* Add `?list=neo` to the URL for kanji grouped by their "cores"
  * The "cores" are usually, but not always, the phonetic parts
    (e.g., the core of 海 is 毎, and the core of 毎 is 母)
  * The "cores" are further grouped into 14 themes
    (Nature, Plant, Animal, Posture, Family, Society, Head, Hand, Body, Home, Work, Weapon, Location, Abstract)
  * This is similar to how [Hanzigong](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ppasupat/hanzigong.html) arranges characters
  * The list is not finalized yet; some kanji might get rearranged as needed

# Resources used

Apart from the character lists from official sources, here are the resources used:

* [Japanese: The Spoken Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese:_The_Spoken_Language):
  Upper vocabulary list. The color corresponds to where the word is introduced.
* [Jonathan Waller's JLPT Vocab Lists](http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/):
  Lower vocabulary list. The light gray words are N3 or below, while the dark gray words are N2.
  N1 might be added if I pass N2. :)
